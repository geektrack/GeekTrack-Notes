#Unit Testing:
1. Got 3 phases: Arrange -> Act -> Assert
2. Arrange: Consists of the test subject i.e. the data or part which is to be tested. Since this is the phase of arranging all the necessary configuration for test	
			It is known as "Arrange".
			
3. Act: Perform process or operations based on the Arrange phase e.g - Method call which will lead to creation of some result. "Act"-ing on the basis of all the arrangements
		is called "Act".
		
4.Assert: In most testing scenarios there are two components present which are - expected result and original result. Expected as the name suggests is the result which is correct
		  and acceptable form of data e.g- A method called Add which take 2 int as parameters returns correct sum for the same. Original refers to the result we obtain in "Act"
		  phase. Comparing the results and if they are equal or as expected, "Assert" phase is completed.
